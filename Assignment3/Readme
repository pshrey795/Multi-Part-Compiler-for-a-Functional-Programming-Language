The submission belongs to Shrey J. Patel (2019CS10400)

The submission folder consists of the following files:

1) A3.lex  -> ML-Lexer file for scanning
2) A3.yacc -> ML-Yacc file for parsing
3) AST.sml -> AST data structure for production and semantic rules
4) typeChecker.sml -> SML file for type checking of input file
5) evaluator.sml -> SML file to evaluate expressions
6) binder.sml -> Glue code to combine all the above files
7) loader.sml -> Linker code to include the required files/libraries
8) Makefile -> For building and executing the above files


-How to build the files?

All the files can be build using "make all" on command line. The build 
files can be deleted by using "make clean"

-How to run the files?

1) The first and second parts of the assignment require only the lexer 
and parser files. The parser and lexer can be executed in SML interactive
environment by typing:

"run <path of testcase(string)>"

2) The third part of the assignment requires type checking and evaluation
of the input file. If there is no syntax error in parts 1 and 2, the
type checker can be invoked using :

"checkType <path of testcase(string)>"

3) If there are no type errors, then the input file can be evaluated
using the command:

"evaluate <path of testcase(string)>"



-Important:

I couldn't install mlton compiler on Ubuntu 20.10 groovy 
because of compatibility issues, due to which:

1) I couldn't generate an executable for the above files and instead I
have used the SML interactive environment for execution.

2) The row and column counters used for displaying the error location 
are inconsistent.
